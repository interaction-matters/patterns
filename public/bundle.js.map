If the button role is added to an element that is not focusable by itself (such as \n              <code className=\"inline\">span</code>, <code className=\"inline\">div</code> or <code className=\"inline\">p</code>)\n              the tabindex attribute will have to be used to make the button focusable.</p>\n              \n              <p>Buttons need to be operable by mouse users as well as keyboard users. For native HTML <code className=\"inline\">button</code> elements, \n              the button's onclick event will fire both for mouse clicks and when the space key is pressed while the button has focus. \n              But if another tag is used instead to create a custom button, the onclick event will only fire when clicked by the mouse cursor, \n              even if <code className=\"inline\">role=\"button\"</code> is used. Because of this, the developer will have to explicitly add a separate key event handler to the element so that the button \n              can be triggered when the space key is pressed.</p>   \n          </Panel>\n        </div>\n        <Panel>\n          <h4>React Proptypes</h4>\n          <p>The following prop types are available to this component:</p>\n          <p>\n            <code className=\"inline\">type</code>,&nbsp;\n            <code className=\"inline\">role</code>,&nbsp;\n            <code className=\"inline\">width</code>,&nbsp;\n            <code className=\"inline\">size</code>,&nbsp;\n            <code className=\"inline\">position</code>,&nbsp;\n            <code className=\"inline\">iconOnly</code>,&nbsp;\n            <code className=\"inline\">icon</code>\n          </p>\n        </Panel>\n        <Panel>\n          <h4>Browser Support</h4>\n          <p>[Table denoting browser support]</p>\n        </Panel>\n      </div>\n\n    );\n  }\n\n};\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./epo/uxlibrary/pages/buttons/ButtonsPage.jsx\n **/","/***************\nA basic alert\n****************/\n\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\n\nimport styles from './alert.scss';\n\nexport default class Alert extends Component {\n\n  render() {\n\n  \tvar className = 'ui-alert ui-alert--' + this.props.type;\n\n    return (\n    \t<div className={className}>{this.props.children}</div>\n    );\n  }\n\n};\n\nAlert.defaultProps = {\n  type: 'primary'\n}\n\n\n/** WEBPACK FOOTER **\n ** ./epo/components/elements/alert/alert.jsx\n **/","// style-loader: Adds some css to the DOM by adding a <style> tag\n\n// load the styles\nvar content = require(\"!!./../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js?includePaths[]=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/patterns/node_modules!./alert.scss\");\nif(typeof content === 'string') content = [[module.id, content, '']];\n// add the styles to the DOM\nvar update = require(\"!./../../../../node_modules/style-loader/addStyles.js\")(content, {});\nif(content.locals) module.exports = content.locals;\n// Hot Module Replacement\nif(module.hot) {\n\t// When the styles change, update the <style> tags\n\tif(!content.locals) {\n\t\tmodule.hot.accept(\"!!./../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js?includePaths[]=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/patterns/node_modules!./alert.scss\", function() {\n\t\t\tvar newContent = require(\"!!./../../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js!./../../../../node_modules/sass-loader/index.js?includePaths[]=/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/patterns/node_modules!./alert.scss\");\n\t\t\tif(typeof newContent === 'string') newContent = [[module.id, newContent, '']];\n\t\t\tupdate(newContent);\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\t// When the module is disposed, remove the <style> tags\n\tmodule.hot.dispose(function() { update();
